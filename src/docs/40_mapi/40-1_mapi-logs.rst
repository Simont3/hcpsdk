MAPI - Log Resources
====================

..  versionadded:: 0.9.3

..  automodule:: hcpsdk.mapi
    :synopsis: Access to selected Management API (:term:`MAPI`) functionality.

This class allows to request internal logs from HCP, which will then prepare
a zip-file to be downloaded later on.

..  Note::

    To be able to use this class, HCP needs to run at least
    **version 7.2**.

The usage pattern is this:

    *  *prepare()*
    *  check the *status()* until *readyForStreaming* is True, then
    *  *download()* the logs
    *  save the zip'ed logs or process them, what ever is needed.
    *  *close()* the underlying *Connection()* object
