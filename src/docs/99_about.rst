**About the Developer**

The developer serves for Hitachi Data Systems since
2007, with a main focus on **Hitachi Content Platform** and its
surrounding products. Being a presales consultant with HDS Germany for
more than six years, he actually works for HCP engineering as an HCP
Technologist for the EMEA region.

Prior to HDS, he served for eight years as a presales manager for
a major storage vendor in Germany. Before that, he worked for ten years
as a software developer, system programmer, project manager and
technical architect for a major German manufacturing company.

In his spare time, he develops tools around HCP that make his own (and
hopefully) others life easier.
