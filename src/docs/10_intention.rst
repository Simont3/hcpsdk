Intention
=========


There are several needs that led to the creation of the HCP SDK:

    *   Blueprint implementation of a connector module to
        access HCPs authenticated namespaces in a language that is easy
        enough to understand for any developers, whatever language she/he
        normally uses, to provide a base for own development.
    *   Showcase for coding guidelines outlined in the :doc:`05_preface`.
    *   Demonstration material for developer trainings.
    *   And last, but not least, a replacement for the various modules
        the author used in the past for his own coding projects.
